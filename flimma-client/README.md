# HyFed Client
The client component of the **HyFed** framework provides the participants with a simple GUI to join the project, obtain the project info/parameters from 
the server, select the dataset to contribute to the study, and keep track the status/progress of the project. More importantly, it handles the communication 
with the server and computes the model parameters from the local data. The **HyFed** client has been 
implemented using **Python** 3.6 and the **tkinter** package.
